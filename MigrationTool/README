improved_script.py:

This script takes an old version of the annotated Java api and cautiously merges as many of those annotations as it can into an unannotated version of the Java API. 

To run it,
	python improved_script.py --old [old annotated Java package, like java6/net] --new [new, un-annotated Java package, like java8/net] --out [the name of the directory you want to create, annotated version of your new package argument]

It will output a file "report," which tells you where you still need to perform manual edits. It's nice to do these with a mouse and a good text editor like Sublime.
It will also output a file called files_not_in_both_packages.txt. This will tell you the disparity in files between your old and new java packages, including subpackages which are not present in both.
